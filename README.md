The Preview has how the layers look like when stacked.
The Background layers folder has all these pngs but in a dark foresty look.
I want them red scaled like the sky should give an acopalyptic sort of look not orangy sunset. And the layers should stack well i mean dont want it to look unnatural.

For the hooded protagonist i want an "anti" of the given protagonist like an evil alter ego type, just change the color of the hoody and eyes or something that would go well with the new red BG. 
The original spritesheet is given and I want the same spritesheet but for this new anti of the given protagonist.
